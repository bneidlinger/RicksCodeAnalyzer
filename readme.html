## What is this?

This is a code analyzer that scans your code and tells you just how terrible it actually is. It provides basic stats, detects issues, and generates reports with visualizations.

## Key Features

- **Basic Code Analysis:** Counts lines, detects languages, finds the largest files
- **Advanced Analysis:** Detects code smells, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues
- **HTML Reports:** Generates fancy reports with charts
- **Fun Analysis:** Detects Rick & Morty references and assigns personality traits to your files
- **Retro Terminal UI:** Because boring corporate tools are for Jerrys
